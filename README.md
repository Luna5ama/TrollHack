# FAQ
Before opening an issue, please consider the following:  
- Are you on the very latest version? In this case, it should be 0.0.5
- Did you compile it yourself, or did you use the release?
- Are your graphics drivers up to date?
- Are you using fast render? (If your version is below 0.0.5, you must upgrade to fix the fast render crash)  
If you're sure you've tried everything, open an issue. [How to ask a good question](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

# Can't open the GUI?
- The default GUI key is **Y**, and the default chat command prefix is **;**
